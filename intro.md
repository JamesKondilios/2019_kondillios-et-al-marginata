####Biogeography of southern WA (diversity hotspot)

The south-western region of Western Australia is an extremely rich pocket of biodiversity within the Australian biosphere, accounting for at least 1.4% of world plant species. This region is home to 5 of Australia’s 15 national biodiversity hotspots  ([www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/hotspots/national-hotspots.html](http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/hotspots/national-hotspots.html)) , making it the subject of great scientific and botanic interest since the late 1800’s. 

In this time frame, the region has lost nearly 90% of its primary vegetation (^), and remains significantly threatened by the effects of climate change.

####Restoration theory - climate adjusted provenancing

Climate adjusted seed provenancing strategies aim to enhance the climate-resilience of trees planted as part of landscape restoration projects. They take into account fact that climate conditions when a seedling is planted may differ to those of when the seedling is fully matured, thus weakening genetic adaptations to the local environment. Climate adjusted seed provenancing strategies combine genetic diversity, and seed-selection from sites biased towards the projected future climate of the target restoration site. The aim of such is to incorporate predicted pre-adapted genotypes (to future environmental conditions) into the gene pool of the target population. This, in conjunction with phenotype plasticity and selection within the gene pool of the target population, offers the best method to capture adaptive potential to the future projected climate.

####Landscape genomics

**Landscape genomics is …, and is useful for understanding relationships between genomes, geography and environment.** 

 Landscape genomic techniques allow us to interrogate of genomic relationships between individuals in a population, and the environmental gradients that they exist across. 

**Landscape genomic studies facilitate landscape restoration, as we can genomically pre-select seed stock adapted to future climate.  How?**

By understanding how the genetic composition of a population differs with its respective environmental gradients such as annual rainfall or temperature, we can associate an individuals genomic composition with adaptation to an interval on that gradient. With this understanding, we can also examine patterns of isolation by distance (IBD), and isolation by environment (IBE). IBD describes the functional-for[[MOU1\]](#_msocom_1) m (strong linear, non-linear, exponential etc.) of the relationship between genomic distance and geographic distance between individuals of a population. Likewise IBE describes the functional-form of the relationship between genomic distance and environmental distance while controlling for geographic distance.

 

####Generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM):

Generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM; ferrier et al) is a modelling framework that allows a distance matrix to be modelled by a combination of geographic location, and other explanatory variables. 

 GDM can used to learn relationships between genetic distance, and geographic and environmental distance giving valuable insight into patterns of IBD and IBE. 

 In the context of modelling susceptibility to climate change

·      **GDM is …., and allows us to interrogate the relationships between genomes, geography and environment.**

·      **GDM allows for non-linear relationships between …,  making it better for doing Landscape genomics because …**

**How we use GDM differently:**

####Aims:

·      **Characterise population structure, isolation by distance, and isolation by environment across geographic and bioclimatic gradients**

·      **Identify geographic regions of genomic variance that are3 likely to be suited for a future climate within the natural species distribution region**

·      **Provide a site specific empirical model for seed sourcing from variants whom which we predict to be pre-adapted to future climates**

 [[MOU1\]](#_msoanchor_1)NOTE: in Megans paper, “correlation” is used as opposed to “functional-form” for descriptions of IBE and IBD. I disagree with the use of correlation because it implies linearity. As we know, and the benefit of using GDM is that it accounts for non linear relationships between these variables.
