## Discussion:

- **Re-hash introduction**

  - What we did.

  - Value of this study.

    

- **Genomic distance between sample transects, and how it changes with respect to geography**

  - Not much in the way of genomic distance, why was this? Speculate..

    

- **GDM results - how variables are expected to change over time**

  - Variables as drivers of genome wide variation across the landscape.

  - Variables included in the model are predicted to change significantly over time.

  - What these variables indicate about *E. Marginata*

    

- **How jaolo's paper showed the same variables were significant**

  - Which variables were included in Megans/how ours differ, and what this could mean?

  

- **The three "groups" which were similar. (biased by the fact that we only have three colours, but results are consistent with previous studies)**

  

- **From pops to individuals: contrast differences between ours and megans**

  

- **Hypothetical restoration protocol.**
