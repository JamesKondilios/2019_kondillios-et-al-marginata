# Genomic guidance for landscape restoration of *Eucalyptus marginata*


Natural ecosystems face myriad challenges in current times, but through well-managed ecosystem restoration there is hope to preseve and protect ecosystems.  The south-western region of Western Australia (SWWA) is extremely biodiverse, and has recieved immense scientific and botanic interest since the late 1800’s.  This region is home to 5 of Australia’s 15 national biodiversity hotspots [^envreport], and at least 1.4% of world plant species CITENEEDED. However, SWWA faces many ongoing threats, including climate change CITENEEDED and deforrestation: the region has lost nearly 90% of its primary vegetation in the last 200 years [@myers00_biodiversity].  


*Eucalyptus marginata* (Donn ex Sm.; "Jarrah") is a foundation tree species endemic to SWWA, being the keystone species of Jarrah woodlands that cover XXX square km CITENEEDED. *Eucalyptus marginata* generally occurs in regions that recieve above 600mm precipiation annually CITENEEDED, and varies in form from a short, multistemed "mallee" in drier, inland areas to tall (up to 40m) trees in wetter localities. *Eucalyptus marginata* forrests are vulnerable to both bioitic and abiotic stressors, being susceptiable to *Phytophthora* infection CITENEEDED, and posessing low resistance to combined drough and heat stress [^jarahccdrough]. These features make *E. marginata* an ideal candiate for targeted restoration efforts.

Much ink has been spilled in recent decades regarding optimal strategies for ecosystem restoration. The general concensus that has emerged advocates balancing genetic diversity (i.e. adapatablity) with enhanced climate resilliance (though targeted provenancing) [e.g. "Climate-adjusted provenancing"; @prober15_climate-adjusted]. In particular, genetic information has a cruical role in guiding restoration efforts. Genetic information illuminates the historical extent of gene flow, and illuminates the senstivity of gene flow to changes in various environemental variables. Restoration efforts can then use this information to determine the geographic and environmental range over provenancing occur without introducing highly divergent germplasm that might risk outbreeding depression or be pooly adapted to current or future environments CITENEEDED.



####Landscape genomics

**Landscape genomics is …, and is useful for understanding relationships between genomes, geography and environment.** 

 Landscape genomic techniques allow us to interrogate of genomic relationships between individuals in a population, and the environmental gradients that they exist across. 

**Landscape genomic studies facilitate landscape restoration, as we can genomically pre-select seed stock adapted to future climate.  How?**

By understanding how the genetic composition of a population differs with its respective environmental gradients such as annual rainfall or temperature, we can associate an individuals genomic composition with adaptation to an interval on that gradient. With this understanding, we can also examine patterns of isolation by distance (IBD), and isolation by environment (IBE). IBD describes the functional-form[^MOU1]  (strong linear, non-linear, exponential etc.) of the relationship between genomic distance and geographic distance between individuals of a population. Likewise IBE describes the functional-form of the relationship between genomic distance and environmental distance while controlling for geographic distance.



ibe paper by bradberg. describes it all as patterns.  IBE is the results of processes and shit. and untestable - however the pattern is detectable. - kevins paper includes this. 

 

####Generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM):

Generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM; ferrier et al) is a modelling framework that allows a distance matrix to be modelled by a combination of geographic location, and other explanatory variables. 

 GDM can used to learn relationships between genetic distance, and geographic and environmental distance giving valuable insight into patterns of IBD and IBE. 

 In the context of modelling susceptibility to climate change


     **GDM is …., and allows us to interrogate the relationships between genomes, geography and environment.**

     **GDM allows for non-linear relationships between …,  making it better for doing Landscape genomics because …**

**How we use GDM differently:**

       **Looking at the individual with transects**



####Aims:

· **Characterise population structure, isolation by distance, and isolation by environment across geographic and bioclimatic gradients**

· **Identify geographic regions of genomic variance that are likely to be suited for a future climate within the natural species distribution region**

· **Provide a site specific empirical model for seed sourcing from variants whom which we predict to be pre-adapted to future climates**

 

[^MOU1]: JK NOTE: in Megans paper, “correlation” is used as opposed to “functional-form” for descriptions of IBE and IBD. I disagree with the use of correlation because it implies linearity. As we know, and the benefit of using GDM is that it accounts for non linear relationships between these variables.
